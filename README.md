tweetYoSelf
===========

Abstract:

  Twitter is a network of publishers and subscribers of messages that are all stored and distributed centrally by the Twitter company.
  
  The messages published and subscribed to in the Twitter network are encoded according to a proprietary protocol defined by the Twitter API
  
  The Twitter API not only defines the message structure of the messages in the Twitter network, but also defines the properties and functions
  of Twitter nodes in the Twitter network - where Twitter "nodes" are the publishers and subscribers of Twitter messages in the Twitter network.
  
  Tweet-yo-self is intended to give publishers of messages in the Twitter network ownership of their published messages.
  
  In its first iteration, Tweet-yo-self will be used to enhance a tweeter t's Twitter node by storing in t's chosen datastore all of t's Twitter messages.
  
  Once t's messages are stored by Tweet-yo-self, Tweet-yo-self will provide tools for organizing t's messages.
  
  Further iterations and consequences are left to the imagination of contributers to Tweet-yo-self.
